# Final-Project
In this project, we will act as a security engineer supporting an organization's SOC infratructure. The SOC analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the security engineering team to investigate and confirm that newly created alerts are working.

If the alerts are working, we will then monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system.
Then, we will report back findings to the manager with appropriate analysis.

# The Objective
1. Implement alarms and thresholds in Kibana and Elasticsearch Watcher.
2. Identify system vulnerabilities and exploits on Wordpress site.
3. Hardening of the vulnerable system.
4. Use Wireshark to make an analysis and detect a traffic on the wire.

Thus, this project devided into three parts: [Red Team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JzBNNukLwWUuU4X_G2vrrHWOg5oQCwUGrRJy87Epb4k/edit?usp=sharing), [Blue Team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-zBjTjKZKu32FfP2Z3kGeR_rRGpRIw-1wsdHQbnKChk/edit?usp=sharing), and [Network Analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/182HyH1DD275fVDeJEXGJJgFLLXUiKBeXgZDpNEVzbTM/edit?usp=sharing) files.
